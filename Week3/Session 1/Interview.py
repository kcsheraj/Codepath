# Problem 1: Balanced Art Collection

# As the curator of an art gallery, you are organizing a new exhibition.
#  You must ensure the collection of art pieces are balanced to attract
#  the right range of buyers. A balanced collection is one where the difference between
#  the maximum and minimum value of the art pieces is exactly 1.

# Given an integer array art_pieces representing the value of each art piece
# write a function find_balanced_subsequence() that returns the length of the
# longest balanced subsequence.

# A subsequence is a sequence derived from the array by deleting some or no
# elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

# def find_balanced_subsequence(art_pieces):
#     pass
# Example Usage:

# art_pieces1 = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
# art_pieces2 = [1,2,3,4]
# art_pieces3 = [1,1,1,1]

# print(find_balanced_subsequence(art_pieces1))
# print(find_balanced_subsequence(art_pieces2))
# print(find_balanced_subsequence(art_pieces3))
# Example Output:

# 5
# Example 1 Explanation:  The longest balanced subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
