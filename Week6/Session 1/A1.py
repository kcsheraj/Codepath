# Problem 1: Selective DNA Deletion
# As a biologist, you are working on editing a long strand of DNA represented as a linked list of nucleotides. Each nucleotide in the sequence is represented as a node in the linked list, where each node contains a character ('A', 'T', 'C', 'G') representing the nucleotide.

# Given the head of the linked list dna_strand and two integers m and n, write a function edit_dna_sequence() that simulates the selective deletion of nucleotides in a DNA sequence. You will: - Start at the beginning of the DNA strand. - Retain the first m nucleotides from the current position. - Remove the next n nucleotides from the sequence. - Repeat the process until the end of the DNA strand is reached.

# Return the head of the modified DNA sequence after removing the mentioned nucleotides.

# Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

# # Problem 2: Protein Folding Loop Detection
# # As a biochemist, you're studying the folding patterns of proteins, which are represented as a sequence of amino acids linked together. These proteins sometimes fold back on themselves, creating loops that can impact their function.

# # Given the head of a linked list protein where each node in the linked list represents an amino acid in the protein, return an array with the values of any cycle in the list. A linked list has a cycle if at some point in the list, the nodeâ€™s next pointer points back to a previous node in the list.
